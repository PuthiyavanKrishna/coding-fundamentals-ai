A comprehensive guide to understanding the fundamental coding technologies behind AI and AI agents. This repository contains practical examples and implementations for web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), machine learning (Python), and mobile app development (Flutter).

## 🛠 Technologies Covered
1. **HTML** - Structure for web interfaces
2. **CSS** - Styling and responsive design
3. **JavaScript** - Client-side interactivity
4. **Python** - Machine learning, data science, and backend API
5. **Flutter** - Cross-platform mobile app development
